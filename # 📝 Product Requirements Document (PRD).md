## üîê Feature Implementation Prompts

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) System

**Prompt:** "Implement a comprehensive two-factor authentication system with the following requirements:

1. **Multiple 2FA Methods**: Support Authenticator App (TOTP), SMS, and Email verification
2. **Code Expiration**: SMS and Email codes expire after 10 minutes
3. **Conditional UI**: Hide resend button for Authenticator App, show for SMS/Email
4. **Pre-Enablement Verification**: For SMS/Email 2FA, require code verification before enabling
5. **Dynamic Method Display**: UI should show correct method (SMS/Email/Authenticator) based on user's setup
6. **Security Best Practices**: 
   - Don't log sensitive codes
   - Use actual email sending for verification
   - Store temporary codes in database with expiration
   - Clear codes after verification attempts

**Technical Requirements:**
- Frontend: Angular components for 2FA setup and verification
- Backend: FastAPI endpoints for code sending, verification, and 2FA management
- Database: Add temp_code and temp_code_expires_at fields to TwoFactorAuth model
- Email Integration: Reuse existing SMTP configuration for 2FA emails
- Token Management: Handle temporary tokens for 2FA flow vs regular JWT tokens

**User Flow:**
1. User enables 2FA in account settings
2. For SMS/Email: Send verification code ‚Üí User enters code ‚Üí Enable 2FA
3. For Authenticator: Generate QR code ‚Üí User scans ‚Üí Enable 2FA
4. During login: User enters 2FA code ‚Üí Complete authentication"

3. **Schema Location**: All schema changes go in `/app/core/init_db.py` and `database.py`
4. **Field Management**: Support adding columns, renaming columns, and adding tables
5. **Data Integrity**: Ensure existing data is preserved during schema updates

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use SQLAlchemy's create_all() for automatic schema generation
- Handle new fields with proper defaults and nullable settings
- Support both SQLite and MySQL databases
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document schema changes in code comments"

### Email Integration for User Flows

**Prompt:** "Implement email integration for user authentication and notification flows:

### Enhanced Trusted Device Management for Financial App

**Prompt:** "Implement a comprehensive "Remember Device" system for a personal finance application that handles sensitive financial data, bank connections, and transaction uploads. The system must balance security with user convenience while meeting financial industry security standards.

**Requirements:**

1. **Database Schema & Models**:
   - Create TrustedDevice model with fields: id, user_id, device_hash, token_hash, created_at, expires_at, last_used_at, user_agent, ip_address, location, is_active
   - Add trusted_device_id field to UserSession model for tracking
   - Implement automatic cleanup of expired trusted device records

2. **Backend API Endpoints**:
   - POST /auth/trust-device - Create trusted device token after successful 2FA
   - DELETE /auth/trust-device/{device_id} - Revoke specific trusted device
   - GET /auth/trusted-devices - List user's trusted devices
   - POST /auth/verify-trusted-device - Validate trusted device token
   - Modify existing login endpoints to check for valid trusted devices

3. **Device Fingerprinting**:
   - Implement device fingerprinting using: browser, OS, screen resolution, timezone, language, plugins
   - Create unique device hash from fingerprint data
   - Validate device fingerprint on each request with trusted token

4. **Security Features**:
   - Generate cryptographically secure random tokens (32+ characters)
   - Hash tokens before database storage
   - Implement 7-day expiration for trusted devices
   - Add geographic restrictions (block new countries/regions)
   - Implement IP change monitoring and alerts
   - Add rate limiting for trusted device operations

5. **Risk-Based Authentication**:

   - Enhanced verification for: bank account connections, large transactions, account changes
   - Implement suspicious activity detection

6. **Frontend Components**:
   - Add "Remember this device" checkbox on 2FA verification screen
   - Create trusted devices management page in account settings
   - Display device list with: device name, location, last used, actions (revoke)
   - Add security notifications for suspicious activity

7. **Audit & Monitoring**:
   - Log all trusted device operations (create, use, revoke)
   - Track device usage patterns and locations
   - Implement fraud detection for unusual patterns
   - Add admin dashboard for security monitoring

8. **User Experience**:
   - Clear messaging about security implications
   - Graceful handling of expired/invalid trusted devices
   - Emergency access recovery options
   - Security education tooltips and help content
