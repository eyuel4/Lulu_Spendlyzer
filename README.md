## System Error Handling & Logging

The application implements comprehensive error handling and logging that:

- **Database Persistence**: All system errors and audit events are logged to the database with async persistence
- **Frontend Integration**: Frontend errors are automatically sent to the backend for logging
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: User actions, system events, and security events are fully logged
- **Error Classification**: Distinguishes between user-facing errors and system errors
- **Hides Technical Details**: Users don't see confusing system error messages
- **Maintains Debugging**: Developers can access complete logs for troubleshooting
